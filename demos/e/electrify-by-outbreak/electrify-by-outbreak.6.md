# NAME
electrify-by-outbreak - the command to run Electrify.

# SYNOPSIS
electrify-by-outbreak [*options*]

# DESCRIPTION
Electrify is a demonstration released by Outbreak in 2010.

Once a year the members of Outbreak gathers to produce a multimeda 
demonstration for the demo competition at Compusphere. The year 2010 was no
exception.

By making the entry for 2010, the shortest entry yet, Outbreak managed to have
the demo finished by the third deadline. This was a new record. Thinking that
we started the demomaking on friday afternoon you can imagine the stress :-)

The theme for the 2010 demo was glow, lines, colors and cubes since that's
what we know.

code:  thec
code:  breakin
music: nightbeat

The demo has no greetings for aesthetic reasons but outbreak like to say hi to:

   panda designs
