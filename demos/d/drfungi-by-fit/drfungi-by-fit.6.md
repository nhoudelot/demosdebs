Requires OpenGL and at least a 300MHz machine. Graphics and sound done
with SDL by Sam Lantinga (http://www.libsdl.org/). OSX version of the SDL
together with ATI's drivers may cause sudden system crashes and almost 
prevented us from entering the compo. Parameter -w from command line will 
run the demo in window.
