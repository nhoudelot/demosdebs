Description: Demo for Linux, released in 2011
 Welcome to Vovoid's latest demo - this time about Luna - an android girl
 with a mission gone astray, wrongfully labeled as broken and dumped through a
 burial portal at a cemetery for androids.
 .
 But the workers discover something amazing...
 .
 For screenshots, music download, mid-production documentation head over to
 http://www.vovoid.org/luna-reactivation/
 .
 This demo has taken more than 3 years to make, so we hope you enjoy it!
 A lot happens in threads, so a quad core machine is preferred.
 Also 4GB of RAM is needed.
 .
 And please, please if possible view it in 1080p, it was designed for that.
 720p doesn't do it justice and you miss out on a lot of details. See the
 screenshots if you like.
