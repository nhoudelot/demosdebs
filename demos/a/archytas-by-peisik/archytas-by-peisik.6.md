info:
  This is our partycoded entry for the AltParty '11 
  Alternative Demo compo. We ran into some tiny 
  technical problems close to the deadline, so 
  some compromises were made. 

  No shaders were harmed in the making of this entry.

technical:
  This demo uses OpenGL, GLu, SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image 
  and OpenGL, so you need to have the respective 
  libraries installed to run this demo. Tested on 
  Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.10.

additional notice: 
  The demo might (will) end with a segfault, no reason
  to panic, that's normal behaviour ;)
