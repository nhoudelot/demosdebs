This is the inofficial invitation to Buenzli 14, made in quite a hurry to have
   a release at Iradium 2005. The official invitational demostration will be
  released somewhen later (read: Breakpoint 2005). It was our idea to create
   something noisy, flashy and fast and we think it turned out pretty well.
