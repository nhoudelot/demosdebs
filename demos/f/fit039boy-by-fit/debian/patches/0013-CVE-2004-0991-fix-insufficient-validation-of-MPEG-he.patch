Subject: CVE-2004-0991: fix insufficient validation of MPEG header values

Taken from mpg123/0.59r-19 by a process of elimination (all the diff
from upstream in layer2.c, except the bits that are CVE-2004-0805)
since I can't find the original patch anywhere. This includes both the
original patch in -18, and the follow-up patch in -19 fixing an
off-by-one error in this boundary check.
