Raytro 4k intro for GNU/Linux by glaze/wAMMA, released \@ Pouet.net
2008\-02\-27
.PP
This is my first released 4k intro.
I don\[aq]t like C, especially when coding 3D stuff, but C++ is too
bloaty and asm is non\-portable.
I didn\[aq]t use music in this intro, because I\[aq]m more interested to
discover how much graphics code I can get into 4k.
.PP
I also tried to compile a win32 version using i586\-mingw32msvc\-gcc
that came with Kubuntu (it uses gcc 3.4.5).
There was missing/weird graphics in some places, so I didn\[aq]t include
a win32 build.
