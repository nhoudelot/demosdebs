# since drop of 32 bit isos, pandoc is not available on some distributions
# it's impossible to dynamicaly generate the manual for 32 bit packages
#
# so, on change, it's important to keek the original markdown file 
# and generate the manual with this line :
# pandoc -s -t man -f markdown debian/inconsistency-by-hymy.6.md -o debian/inconsistency-by-hymy.6
