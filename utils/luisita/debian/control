Description: scriptable graphics environment for real-time applications (demos)
 Luisita is an scriptable graphics environment Ã  la Processing, only it's based
 on Lua & C++.
 It enables you to program graphic real-time applications (demos) without
 digging too deep into OpenGL or fighting with C++'s memory management. Its
 basic premise is to provide an easy to understand environment for newbies so
 they can begin with some scripting and maybe jump to c/c++ later, but it can be
 used by experts alike. The only limit is your imagination :-)
 .
 Demos written with Luisita consist in a demo script which uses the provided set
 of simple functions for handling graphics and music. This set is intentionally
 reduced and minimalist.
 .
 It uses Lua for scripting, Bass for playing sound, OpenGL for displaying
 graphics and Simple OpenGL Image Library for loading images.
