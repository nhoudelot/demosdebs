Description: Dolby B software decoder
 Many people may have old recordings made in Dolby B or C.
 However if your expensive Dolby deck breaks down, it may be hard to justify the
 expense of buying a new Dolby deck.
 .
 Why recordings can't be digitised using a cheaper deck, and then
 decoded in software ?
 .
 So far it's a program to decode recordings made in Dolby B. It was
 intend to implement Dolby C decoding, but still working on that.
