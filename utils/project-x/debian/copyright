This original source for this package was obtained via the website
http://sourceforge.net/projects/project-x

It is distributed in a .zip archive, so it had to be repackaged.

Additionally, due to DFSG, the lib/ directory has been removed from 
the .orig.tar.gz due to questionable licensing on multiple binaries 
shipped within it, as well as several unnecessary binaries under 
the Apache License.
