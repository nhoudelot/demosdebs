.SH NAME
aacgain \- normalizes the volume of digital music files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aacgain
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<infile> \fR[\fI<infile 2> \fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
aacgain version 1.9.0, derived from mp3gain version 1.5.2
copyright(c) 2001\-2009 by Glen Sawyer
AAC support copyright(c) 2004\-2009 David Lasker, Altos Design, Inc.
uses mpglib, which can be found at http://www.mpg123.de
AAC support uses faad2 (http://www.audiocoding.com), and
mpeg4ip's mp4v2 (http://www.mpeg4ip.net)
.SS "options:"
.HP
\fB\-v\fR \- show version number
.HP
\fB\-g\fR <i>  \- apply gain i without doing any analysis
.HP
\fB\-l\fR 0 <i> \- apply gain i to channel 0 (left channel)
.IP
without doing any analysis (ONLY works for STEREO files,
not Joint Stereo)
.HP
\fB\-l\fR 1 <i> \- apply gain i to channel 1 (right channel)
.HP
\fB\-e\fR \- skip Album analysis, even if multiple files listed
.HP
\fB\-r\fR \- apply Track gain automatically (all files set to equal loudness)
.HP
\fB\-k\fR \- automatically lower Track/Album gain to not clip audio
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \- apply Album gain automatically (files are all from the same
album: a single gain change is applied to all files, so
their loudness relative to each other remains unchanged,
but the average album loudness is normalized)
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <i> \- modify suggested MP3 gain by integer i
.HP
\fB\-d\fR <n> \- modify suggested dB gain by floating\-point n
.HP
\fB\-c\fR \- ignore clipping warning when applying gain
.HP
\fB\-o\fR \- output is a database\-friendly tab\-delimited list
.HP
\fB\-t\fR \- writes modified data to temp file, then deletes original
.IP
instead of modifying bytes in original file
A temp file is always used for AAC files.
.HP
\fB\-q\fR \- Quiet mode: no status messages
.HP
\fB\-p\fR \- Preserve original file timestamp
.HP
\fB\-x\fR \- Only find max. amplitude of file
.HP
\fB\-f\fR \- Assume input file is an MPEG 2 Layer III file
.IP
(i.e. don't check for mis\-named Layer I or Layer II files)
.IP
This option is ignored for AAC files.
.HP
\-? or \fB\-h\fR \- show this message
.HP
\fB\-s\fR c \- only check stored tag info (no other processing)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR d \- delete stored tag info (no other processing)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR s \- skip (ignore) stored tag info (do not read or write tags)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR r \- force re\-calculation (do not read tag info)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR i \- use ID3v2 tag for MP3 gain info
.HP
\fB\-s\fR a \- use APE tag for MP3 gain info (default)
.HP
\fB\-u\fR \- undo changes made (based on stored tag info)
.HP
\fB\-w\fR \- "wrap" gain change if gain+change > 255 or gain+change < 0
.IP
MP3 only. (use "\-? wrap" switch for a complete explanation)
.PP
If you specify \fB\-r\fR and \fB\-a\fR, only the second one will work
If you do not specify \fB\-c\fR, the program will stop and ask before
.IP
applying gain change to a file that might clip
