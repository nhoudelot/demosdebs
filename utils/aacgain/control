Description: Lossless mp4 normalizer with statistical analysis
 AACGain normalizes the volume of digital music files using the Replay Gain
 algorithm. It works by modifying the global_gain fields in the mp4 samples.
 Free-form metadata tags are added to the file to save undo information,
 making the normalization process reversable. It supports AAC
 (mp4/m4a/QuickTime) audio files in addition to mp3 files.
 .
 AACGain uses the same command-line user interface as mp3gain
