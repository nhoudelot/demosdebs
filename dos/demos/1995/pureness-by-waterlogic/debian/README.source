pureness-by-waterlogic for Debian
-------------------------------

TXT files converted to UTF8

Executable :
 * is compressed with PKLITE(1.15)
   It can be uncompressed with UNP but it cannot be run anymore. So I kept the 
   compressed version
 * is compiled with Borland C/C++(1991) and linked with Borland TLINK(5.0)
