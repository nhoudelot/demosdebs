Description: Intro for Linux, released in 2014
 Matti Henttonen (collateralburger): Synth & music
 Vantte Kilappa (Warma):             'Lavos' shape code
 Tatu Kilappa (Trilkk):              All other code
 .
 FreeBSD-ia32 16k intro for Tokyo Demo Fest 2014 combined intro compo. However,
 entered as wild since the TDF intro compo is Windows-only. Windows and Linux
 ports exist at the time of writing this README, but they do not quite fit into
 16k. Or any other size limit for that matter.
 .
 The premise for this production was for collateralburger to try out programming
 a software synthesizer for the first time. Rest of the intro has been made to
 accommodate. 4k synth would have been quite unreasonable for a first entry into
 introcoding, so the 16k limit serves as a more lax restriction.
 .
 Greets in the intro for once.
