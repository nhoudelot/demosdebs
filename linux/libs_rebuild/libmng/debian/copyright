 1. The origin of this source code must not be misrepresented; you must not

 2. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such and must not be

 .
 3. This Copyright notice may not be removed or altered from any source or

 The Contributing Authors specifically permit, without fee, and encourage the

 format in commercial products.  If you use this source code in a product,
 acknowledgment would be highly appreciated.
 .
 Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package. Although
 this library supports all features from the PNG specification (as MNG descends
 from it) it does not require the libpng package. It does require the zlib
 library and optionally the IJG jpeg library, and/or the "little-cms" library
 by Marti Maria (depending on the inclusion of support for JNG and
 Full-Color-Management respectively.
 .
 This library's function is primarily to read and display MNG animations. It is
 not meant as a full-featured image-editing component! It does however offer
 creation and editing functionality at the chunk level.(future modifications
 may include some more support for creation and or editing)
