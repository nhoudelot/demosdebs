# We don't include symbols files, because on the one hand
# private symbols are exported and not easily distinguishable
# from public ones. They have a leading underscore, but there
# are also public ones with a leading underscore.
# On the other hand, symbols files are not needed, because
# the API is frozen anyway. Quote from Peter Wang:
# "Anyway, 4.4 is on life support.
#  The API is essentially frozen forever."

# False positive, there are no functions to protect.
# There are only strncpy, memset, memcpy and fread.
