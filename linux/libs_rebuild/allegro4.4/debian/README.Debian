Allegro 4 for Debian
====================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

- liballegro<version> - Shared library
- liballegro<version>-dev - Header files
- allegro4-doc - documentation, example source files

For game developers, I suggest to install data files into
/usr/share/games/<game-or-package-name>.  If you have an executable file, which
depends on being executed from the starting directory, you may place this
binary in the /usr/games/ directory, using a name like "game.real", symlink it
to the dat directory and create an small wrapper in /usr/games. Or put the
files in /usr/games, /usr/lib/gamex/*/ and /usr/share/games/*/, corresponding
to their function and platform dependency. See FHS for example.

The -dev package is called 4.2, which doesn't match the so-name. This is done to
ease the 4.2 to 4.4 transition.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allegro should have rational settings by default. To enable DIGMID (software
midi), please install timidity-patches package. To modify Allegro's behaviour,
you can take the example config file from /usr/share/doc/liballegro4.4/examples,
modify and save as /etc/allegro.cfg or ~/.allegrorc .

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Allegro library is a comfortable game development kit, used by over
200 games (in the DOS-version). It is written in C with assembler
optimisations and can be used in C or C++, but also in other languages
via extensions.  Allegro has many features, supports several input
sources and output targets.

Portability:
- DOS
- UNIX
- Win32
- BeOS
...without reinventing the wheel.

2D graphics:
- X window graphics
- DGA2 (Accelerated modes under XFree86-4.0.x)
- Framebuffer (experimental)
- SVGALIB (experimental)
- good driver API, more drivers possible
- high-level drawing routines, simplifying programming

3D graphics:
- integrated software 3D routines
- OpenGL (via extension, in development)

Sound:
- usuall OSS
- misc. playing routines
- MIDI software synthesizer, similar to Timidity
- misc. extensions available, MOD, MP3 player

Input:
- Keyboard, on Console and X11, internationalisation
- Mouse (native drivers, GPM, X11)
- Joystick interface

Support functions:
- image loader (misc. formats, extendable)
- sound loader (wave, midi, extendable)
- advanced handling of data files (compression, virtual filesystem, data
  files embedded into executable)
- environment detection, configuration storing/loading routines, timers,
  image manipulation

Wanna develop with it? Check documentation and examples in the allegro4-doc package.
