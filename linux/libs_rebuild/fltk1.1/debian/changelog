  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends: Swap transitional libgl1-mesa-dev package with formerly

    - libfltk1.1 Breaks: Drop (just affected ancient flwm versions).
    - Standards-Version: 4.5.0 (already compliant).
  * test/menubar.cxx: Formally cast FL_*_LABEL to uchar for use as
    Fl_Menu_Item::labeltype_, as done upstream in the 1.3 branch some time
    ago, and as required by recent Clang versions (9.0.1 at a minimum).

  * debian/compat: Go ahead and advance to 11.
  * debian/control:
    - Advance debhelper B-D version constraint to (>= 11~).
    - Standards-Version: 4.3.0 (fully compliant at this point).
  * debian/rules:
    - Allow (dh_)autoreconf, albeit with autoheader suppressed, and
      configure saved and restored rather than deleted on cleanup.
    - Use /usr/share/dpkg/{architecture,buildflags}.mk instead of calling
      dpkg-{architecture,buildflags} directly (and piecemeal).
    - Use host-specific pkg-config in FTCONFIG for the sake of cross
      builds, per Helmut Grohne.  (Closes: #914480.)
    - override_dh_auto_install-arch: Skip test/ here too for cross builds.
    - override_dh_install-arch: Strip *all* -f*-prefix-map=* flags from
      fltk-config, per Chris Lamb. (Closes: #909078.)
    - override_dh_installchangelogs: Install CHANGES as NEWS(.gz), not

    regression in indep-only buildability.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-24) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/compat: Advance to 10 (holding off on 11 due to lack of
    --runstatedir support).
  * debian/control:
    - Add pkg-config to Build-Depends.
    - Advance debhelper Build-Depends version constraint to (>= 10~).
    - Rules-Requires-Root: no (confirmed not to affect binary packages).
    - Vcs-{Browser,Git}: Move to salsa.debian.org.
    - Standards-Version: 4.1.3 (was just missing nodoc, now implemented).
  * debian/rules:
    - Address FTCBFS, based on a patch from Helmut Grohne (Closes: #887636).
      + Avoid configuring during clean.
      + Do not pass build architecture compiler to configure.
      + In arch-only builds, limit coverage of test/ to the three targets we
        specifically need for fltk1.1-games.  (Many of the others involve
        trying to run freshly built fluid.)
    - Pass "/usr/bin/pkg-config freetype2" off as FTCONFIG (in lieu of
      freetype-config, which is now deprecated).  (Closes: #892341.)
    - Set DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS more readably.
    - Use ?= for DEB_HOST_ARCH, as already done for DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH.
    - override_dh_auto_build-indep: Support nodoc in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    - Run dh --without autoreconf; debhelper enables autoreconf by default
      as of compat level 10, but it breaks here and isn't worth fixing.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-23) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control:
    - Canonicalize with the help of cme fix.  In particular, declare
      Standards-Version: 3.9.8 (already compliant, not that cme checked).
    - Retire explicit libfltk1.1-dbg package in favor of automatic -dbgsym
      packages.
  * debian/libfltk1.1.symbols: GCC's stopped emitting one more destructor
    variant.
  * debian/rules:
    - Stop collecting debug symbols in an explicit libfltk1.1-dbg package.
    - Drop the fltk-config.unhardened business, which proved insufficient.
      (Do, however, postprocess fltk-config to avoid emitting the
      -fdebug-prefix-map=... flag intended to *improve* reproducibility!)
    - Configure --with-optim=... so fltk-config --optim won't claim -Os.
  * debian/.gitignore: Resync.
  * fltk-config.in: Filter out -D*, -f*, and -W*, not just -g* and -O* (but
    leave --optim output alone for reference).  (See #828081.)

  * debian/libfltk1.1.symbols: Mark one symbol newly elided by GCC 6 as

  * debian/rules:
    - Stop generating XPM icons, needed only for the retired .menu entries.
    - Mark override_dh_{auto_install,makeshlibs,strip} as arch-only.
      (indep-only [-A] builds still need to build and run fluid for the sake
      of some installed examples).
    - Preserve fltk.spec across override_dh_auto_{clean,configure}.
  * debian/source/options: Rename back from local-options, per dgit.
  * debian/.gitignore: Unignore patches, per dgit.

    unreproducible IDs, following the general lead of

  * documentation/fluid.html: Tweak syntax so htmldoc won't fail.
  * fltk.spec: Reinstate, per dgit.

    - Re-flag symbols absent when building with clang 3.3 as optional.
      (NB: Building with clang will still fail because it misoptimizes the

    source patches from NMUs will wind up in separate files.
  * src/Makefile: substitute -fPIC for -fPIE in C(XX)FLAGS.
  * test/Makefile: link the threads demo with LDFLAGS, not CXXFLAGS!

      in FLTKConfig.cmake (which however remains in /usr/lib/fltk for now).
    - debian/FLTKConfig.cmake: Rename to FLTKConfig.cmake.in and

  * debian/compat: advance to 8, as it is safe to do so.
  * debian/control:
    - Advance debhelper requirement to (>= 8) per the above.
    - Advance dpkg-dev requirement to (>= 1.15.7) for dpkg-buildflags.
    - Generally clean up relationships; don't worry about anything pre-etch,
      and wildcard the build-dep on libasound2-dev to [linux-any].
    - Set Vcs-* fields to point to (new) personal git.d.o repository.
    - Declare compatibility with Policy version 3.9.1.
  * debian/rules:

      relying on them to be in the environment courtesy of dpkg-buildpackage.
    - Stop passing -D_REENTRANT, which is not only obsolete but redundant.
  * debian/source/{format,options,patch-header}: advance to 3.0 (quilt),
    albeit in single-debian-patch mode per VCS use, for .orig.tar.bz2 support.

    one-liner for compatibility with more desktop environments. (LP: #569518.)

  * Update Spanish Debconf translation, thanks to Franciso Javier Cuadrado.
    (Closes: #513692.)  Apologies for the delay; the submission was slightly
    late for lenny, and as such no longer merited an upload on its own.
  * debian/control:
    - List ${misc:Depends} in Depends across the board, as future Debhelper
      versions could conceivably generate content for it.
    - Clean up Section fields: libfltk1.1 is already implicitly in libs, and
      libfltk1.1-dbg is in the newfangled debug section nowadays. ;-)
    - Advance Standards-Version to 3.8.3.  (No further changes required.)
    - Require debhelper (>= 7.0.50) for further rules simplification.
  * debian/rules:
    - On alpha, lock in a version of 1.1.10~rc2 for symbols introduced when
      building with GCC 4.3, which is now the default on that platform too.
    - Simplify further per debhelper 7.0.50+'s override_dh_* support.

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian still defaults to GCC 4.2 on alpha at present (2008-06-11);
    strip symbols introduced when building with 4.3 regardless of actual
    compiler version so that when the transition occurs, the generated
    dependencies will be suitably tight.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jun 2008 18:12:25 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fl_Choice's post-1.1.7 policy of insisting on a white background in
    the default scheme doesn't work so well when the user has requested a
    white (or nearly white) foreground; revert to honoring the user's
    background choice as well in such cases.  (Closes: #484660.)
  * Update symbols file, as building with GCC 4.3 appears to have
    introduced a handful of new symbols.
  * Declare compliance with Policy 3.8.0.  (No changes required.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:12:09 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release after all, with bug fixes that didn't quite
    manage to make 1.1.8.
  * Migrate from CDBS to Debhelper 7, adding a build dependency on
    dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.17) for baseline CFLAGS determination.

fltk1.1 (1.1.8~rc3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * Drop debian/rules logic to fix games' .desktop Categories, which
    upstream has now modernized.

    FindFLTK.cmake's expectations.  (Closes: #437967.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.8~rc2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Restore single-line fltk-config --libs output for compatibility with
    callers that expected such, even though they probably meant to use
    --ld(static)flags anyway.  (Closes: #470327.)

  * Reformat copyright file slightly to ensure legal validity (per Lintian).
  * Readjust fltk1.1-doc's doc-base section to Programming/C++ per
    doc-base 0.8.10.
  * Add a libfltk1.1.symbols file to permit looser reverse dependencies in
    many cases.
  * Formally move to Debhelper 6, bumping the cdbs requirement to 0.4.51
    to avoid #462130.
  * Update watch file to handle release candidates correctly.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream fix (to be included in 1.1.8 if and when it ever
    materializes) for "fluid -c"'s inappropriate X usage when generating
    code for Fl_Help_View widgets.  (Closes: #455232.)
  * Adjust shared library linkage per dpkg-shlibdeps's new warnings.  The
    only remaining warnings concern libm, which g++ pulls in even when not
    explicitly asked to.
  * Belatedly modernize fltk1.1-doc's doc-base section (Apps -> Applications).
  * Declare compliance with Policy 3.7.3.
  * Debconf templates and debian/control reviewed by the debian-l10n-
    english team as part of the Smith review project.  (Closes: #452494.)
  [Debconf translation updates]

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn fl_xfont into a smart pointer capable of on-demand
    (re)initialization so that future releases with improved core-font
    selection logic need not run it on every single font change.
  * Correct debian/watch.  (Closes: #449636.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 07 Nov 2007 20:23:57 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship binaries of the example games, with ALSA enabled on Linux, in a
    new fltk1.1-games package.  (NB: although upstream's names for the
    games do not appear to conflict with anything currently in Debian,
    they are sufficiently generic that the Debian packages err on the side
    of caution by prepending fl.)
  * Further streamline all executables' shared-library dependencies.
  * Move .desktop files to /usr/share/applications, as /usr/share/applnk
    is deprecated and KDE-only.  (Closes: #444063)
  * Run dh_icons for fluid and fltk1.1-games, also per #444063.
  * Modernize games' .desktop files' Categories settings as well.
  * Drop gratuitous (and typo-ridden) DEB_DH_SHLIBDEPS_ARGS setting.
  * fltk-config(.in) --compile: link FLTK dynamically.  (Closes: #441141.)
  * Declare home page centrally (per dpkg 1.14.6) rather than in descriptions.
  * Accommodate the (atypical) possibility of multi-word CC and CXX settings.
  * Declare those inter-package dependencies that need to be tight with
    ${binary:Version} rather than the deprecated ${Source-Version}.
  * Modernize fluid's Debian menu section (Apps -> Applications).
  * Expand debian/copyright; in particular, clarify that licensees have
    the option of applying newer LGPL versions (than v2.0).
  * Drop old workaround for #365085 in favor of simply requiring a new
    enough cdbs.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure(.in), {src,test}/Makefile: drop unnecessary hardcoded
    dependencies on libXext, zlib, and libGLU, per Nathanael Nerode's
    patch; inaugurate libfltk1.1-dev's NEWS.Debian with a suitable entry.
    (Closes: #405233.)
  * debian/po/es.po: new Spanish translation for libfltk1.1-dev, courtesy
    of César Gómez Martín <cesar.gomez@gmail.com> and Manuel Porras
    Peralta, unfortunately too late for etch.  (Closes: #414453.)

  * debian/po/it.po: new Italian Debconf translation for libfltk1.1-dev,
    thanks to Andrea Bolognani <eof@kiyuko.org>.  (Closes: #358191.)
  * Merge in more fixes from the 1.1 branch, whose likelihood of seeing
    another upstream release is highly uncertain; bump shlibs requirement
    because these add two new public methods.
  * (Build-)depend directly on libgl(u)1-mesa-dev by default (but keep
    the alternate [build-]dependencies on virtual packages, of course).
  * Install fluid-32.xpm, and use it as fluid's menu icon.
  * Move up to debhelper compatibility level 5, and make use of cdbs
    0.4.37's automatic -dbg package handling.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Apr 2006 14:34:24 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; among many other things:
    - Fixes nonsensical sentence in documentation.  (Closes: #341747.)
    - Documents new foreground()/background() paradigm.  (Closes: #343550.)
  * Enable (newly added) Xinerama support and add an appropriate build
    dependency.
  * Build with the default GCC version on all architectures, as g++-4.0 no
    longer suffers from bug #336463 as of revision 4.0.2-4.  (Closes: #342965.)
  * Generally resynch and tidy up debian/rules.
  * Rework installation slightly, and install fluid's new .desktop files.
  * Update version info in pregenerated FLTKConfig.cmake, and stop shipping
    a redundant copy of FLTKUse.cmake now that it's materialized upstream.
  * Extend fluid's internationalization to the two new fluid-generated
    modules (print_panel and template_panel) and attempt (rather
    conservatively, as I know extremely little Spanish) to bring its
    Spanish translation up to date.  Further assistance, and for that
    matter a Spanish Debconf translation, would be appreciated.
  * Resynch with upstream SVN as of Jan. 31, which just adds some belated
    bugfixes.
  * Make fltk-config(.in) list indirect dependencies only for
    --ldstaticflags (vs. --ldflags), and accordingly downgrade most of
    libfltk1.1-dev's dependencies to suggestions.

  * Backport upstream patch to use (user-specified) FL_FOREGROUND_COLOR et
    al. more widely.  (Closes: #332489.)

  * debian/po/sv.po: new Swedish translation, thanks to Daniel Nylander
    <po@danielnylander.se>.  (Closes: #331473.)
  * BTW, libfltk1.1-dev's merged templates file should now be encoded in
    UTF-8 throughout rather than in a hodgepodge of national encodings.

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Clean up build-dependencies now that the dust from the libglu1c2
    fiasco has settled.
  * Give Fl_Check_Browser an appropriate destructor to keep it from
    leaking memory.  (Closes: #321285, but affected programs may need to
    be recompiled to get the fix.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/po/vi.po: add a Vietnamese translation, thanks to Clytie
    Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>.  (Closes: #314172.)
  * debian/*: C++ transition.  (Closes: #317539.)
    - libfltk1.1c102 renamed back to libfltk1.1, as no package by that
      name ever appeared in a release; redundant conflicts dropped.
    - Make sure to use a post-transition libglu1c2 such as libglu1-xorg.
  * debian/control: standards-version 3.6.2 (already compliant).

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert previous change, which seems to have been ineffective for some
    reason, in favor of commenting out the problematic Makefile rule
    altogether.  (Closes: #310151.)
  * debian/control: Go back to specifying the URL as part of the
    description rather than via a non-standard field that doesn't seem to
    have caught on.  (Closes: #310240.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

    of the build.  (This got lost when converting to CDBS years ago; I
    don't know why it didn't bite any of the many intervening releases.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.links: new, for the two header-related links we
    actually want.
  * debian/rules:

  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx: make sure to set fl_xfont to something valid,
    albeit not generally the actual requested font, in fl_font().

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * fluid/Fl_Widget_Type.cxx,src/Fl_Text_Editor.cxx:
    apply upstream's patch for STR #52 (which ate edits in most cases).

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (1.1.4 release candidate 1).
  * FL/Makefile.in, debian/libfltk1.1-dev.{config,postinst,postrm,templates}:
    make deprecated *.h headers optional, via Debconf.  (Closes: #179503)
  * Makefile, makeinclude.in: revert DESTDIR hack.
  * configure: regenerate with Autoconf 2.57 rather than 2.13, since
    upstream uses 2.53 and the diff ends up much smaller.
  * debian/control: bump cdbs build-dep to >= 0.2.8.
  * debian/rules:
    - make sure to build libfltk1.1c102's shlibs file before calculating
      fluid's dependencies.
    - set DEB_MAKE_INSTALL_TARGET per cdbs 0.2.8.
    - set version in shlibs file automatically again.
  * debian/rules.manual: retire.
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx:
    - upstream's fix for gl_font() is Xft1-specific; substitute a much
      cruder version that at least keeps it from segfaulting.
