Description: dynamic universal music bibliotheque
 DUMB is a tracker library with support for IT, XM, S3M and MOD files. It
 targets maximum accuracy to the original formats, with low-pass resonant
 filters for the IT files, accurate timing and pitching, and three resampling
 quality settings (aliasing, linear interpolation and cubic interpolation).
 .
 This package contains the libdumb1 runtime library, a standalone library
 for module playback. If you plan to use the Allegro library with your
 project, please consider the libaldmb1 library.
