Description: SDL 1.2 binary compatibility library wrapping SDL 2.0
 libsdl1.2-compat provides a binary compatible API for programs built
 against SDL 1.2, but using SDL 2.0.
 .
 If you are writing new code, please target SDL 2.0 directly instead
 of using this layer.
 .
 This package only provides the library, in a private location, so
 that it can be co-installed with libsdl1.2debian. It is intended for
 packages with a specific use for the compatibility layer (which
 provides some extra symbols not present in libsdl1.2debian).
 To replace libsdl1.2debian entirely, and use the compatibility layer
 with all SDL 1.2 programs, install libsdl1.2-compat-shim.
