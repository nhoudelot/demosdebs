cenotaphforsoda-by-suricrasiaonline for Debian
---------------------------------------------

I  used only the Makefile in main/
as it's easier, and I only need it to compile

also, didn't compile it until having the 4k part version, to have the 
dependencies.

it's also a 64 bit version, not a 32 bit, like the party version
