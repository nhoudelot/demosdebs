# OPTIONS
there is no options to this program

By default this will render with 1000 samples per pixel, on my machine 
(i7-3720QM/Quadro K1000M) this takes about 165 seconds. 

You can choose the number of samples you want with an environment variable:

SAMPLES=10 internationalshipping

This takes 3 seconds on my machine. See the .nfo file for render timings on a 
K1000M and a 980 Ti. Please note, it will only render if your screen is at least
1920 pixels wide.
