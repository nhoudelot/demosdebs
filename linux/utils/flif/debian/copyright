Comment:
 This software mixes different licenses; the main license (and our
 “wildcard license”) is the LGPLv3+, but the decoding library is
 Apache licensed, and differently licensed files coexist in the same
 directories. For this reason, when importing a new upstream version,
 is it important to check that new files fall in the correct Files
 paragraph. Upstream normally includes a licensing header in each file,
 so a quick consistency check can be done with ‘debmake -k’.

 They are also licensed under the MIT open source license, if you have
 lawyers who are unhappy with public domain. Every source file includes
 an explicit dual-license for you to choose from.
