.SH "CONFIGURATION"
To prevent a profile from being loaded, place a script called "block" in its
directory. The script is evaluated before the screen setup is inspected, and
in case of it returning a value of 0 the profile is skipped. This can be used
to query the status of a docking station you are about to leave.
.PP
If no suitable profile can be identified, the current configuration is kept.
To change this behaviour and switch to a fallback configuration, specify
\fB\-\-default\fR <profile>.
.PP
Another script called "postswitch" can be placed in the directory
~/.config/autorandr (or ~/.autorandr if you have an old installation) as well
as in any profile directories: The scripts are executed after a mode switch
has taken place and can notify window managers.
.SH "VIRTUAL CONFIGURATIONS"
The following virtual configurations are available:
.TP
common
Clone all connected outputs at the largest common resolution
.TP

.TP

.TP
vertical
Stack all connected outputs vertically at their largest resolution
