Description: Crinkler-like for the Linux Scene
 This is an attempt at writing something Crinkler-like for the Linux Scene. It
 provides a context-modeling compressing linker that will transform a .o file
 into a "valid" ELF binary. This is not quite finished yet, the following
 caveats should be taken into account when using:
   - It can only link a single .o file for now.
   - It assumes that you want to link SDL 1.2 and OpenGL, the flags for
   specifying libraries are currently ignored.
   - It may crash if your object file contains some construct it does not expect.
   tested quite a few relocation and data declaration possibilities absolutely 
   certain to have missed a few :-)
   - 32-bit only. While the resulting binaries will run on 64-bit Linux, users
   will need to install the required 32-bit libraries for running your stuff.
