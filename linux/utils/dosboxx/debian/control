Description: DOSBox-X emulates a legacy IBM PC and DOS environment
 DOSBox-X is an open-source DOS emulator for running DOS games and applications.
 DOS-based Windows such as Windows 3.x and Windows 9x are officially supported.
 Compared to DOSBox, DOSBox-X is much more flexible and provides more features.
 .
 DOSBox-X emulates a PC necessary for running many DOS games and applications
 that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems, similar to
 DOSBox. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games,
 DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project,
 it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox
 was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications,
 including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software
 written for those versions of Windows. Moreover,  DOSBox-X adds support for 
 emulating the NEC PC-98 such that you can also play PC-98 games with it.
