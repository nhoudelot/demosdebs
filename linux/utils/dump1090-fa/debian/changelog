dump1090-fa (3.6.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * dump1090: implement speculative decoding for Comm-B messages, capturing
    most of the Mode S EHS data:
    BDS 1,0 (datalink capabilities); BDS 1,7 (GICB capabilities);
    BDS 2,0 (aircraft identification); BDS 3,0 (ACAS RA);
    BDS 4,0 (vertical intention); BDS 5,0 (track and turn);
    BDS 6,0 (heading and speed)

    ADS-B version, autopilot settings, NIC/Rc, NAC, SIL, GVA, etc.
  * dump1090: aircraft state tracking overhaul; track data age in milliseconds
  * dump1090: emit newly decoded fields in aircraft.json
  * Skyview: experimental display of new fields, disabled by default; to
    enable, set ExtendedData = true in config.js or add #extended to the URL

  * faup1090: Restructure emitted data to include data age and source

    user has deliberately disabled it.
  * Fix AGC gain setting.
  * Updated the FlightAware aircraft data export.
  * Minor bugfixes.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Mon, 03 Apr 2017 17:53:48 +0100

dump1090-fa (3.4.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Add bladeRF support.
  * Clean up the FlightAware photos link so it works for registrations containing
    non-alphanumeric characters.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:41:43 +0000

dump1090-fa (3.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Improvements to the Mode A/C demodulator.
  * Automatically enable Mode A/C if a Beast command requesting it is received.
    (disable with --no-modeac-auto)
  * Process the radarcape position message, emit it from faup1090.
  * If view1090 is started with --modeac, request Mode A/C data from dump1090.
  * Remove the last traces of the internal webserver.
  * Updated the FlightAware aircraft data export.
  * Updated the default package-based maximum range to 360NM to match what
    piaware-support configured for sdcard installs.
  * Remove internal webserver code entirely (previously, it was just disabled
    at compile time).
  * Tweak the timing reported for Mode S and Mode A/C messages to match how
    the Beast/Radarcape does it. This affects the interval between Mode S
    and Mode A/C messages only; intervals between Mode S messages and other
    Mode S messages, or A/C and other A/C, are unchanged.

dump1090-fa (3.2.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a stray extra comma in port 30003 output if only GNSS altitude
    was available
  * Track CPR encoding type directly rather than inferring it from airground;
    using airground meant some position messages that should be usable were
    not used
  * Mode A/C aircraft association tuning, allows dump1090 to handle much
    higher A/C rates without chewing tons of CPU
  * Map: Decrease the maximum marker size shown
  * Map: Show additional datasource information (TIS-B etc) in table mode
  * Map: Move the datablock so it doesn't overlap the zoom control
  * Map: Allow skipping the history load by adding a #nohistory fragment
    to the URL (e.g. for high latency connections)
  * view1090-fa: Use ncurses to reduce flicker on remote connections
  * view1090-fa:  Fix knots -> km/h conversion in interactive mode

dump1090-fa (3.1.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Update to latest dump1090-mutability master
  * Preserve more map settings in browser local storage
  * Add a NEXRAD weather layer (US only) to the map
  * Decoder overhaul/cleanup
  * Prefer ES data over Mode S data when both are available
  * Improved air/ground detection
  * Lots of map interface changes:
    * aircraft info moves to a draggable popup rather than top of the sidebar
    * sidebar is resizeable / hideable
    * table-only (no map) mode
    * improved FlightAware aircraft links
    * configurable units display (metric / imperial / aeronautical)
    * filter displayed aircraft by altitude
    * option to show all aircraft tracks
    * more aircraft markers
    * use aircraft markers based on aircraft type info where available
    * scale marker size based on zoom to avoid overlap when zoomed out
  * Include a greatly expanded aircraft type/registration database (used by the
    map display) based on the publically-distributable parts of FlightAware's
    internal database
  * Try to compute a registration from ICAO address for aircraft where there
    is a predictable mapping (e.g. US N-registrations)
  * Try to coexist with other packages (e.g. dump1090-mutability) that also
    provide a lighttpd config that changes the server.stat-cache-engine setting
  * Serve actual map data on port 8080, not just a redirect
  * Redirect requests for /dump1090-fa to /dump1090-fa/ rather than 404ing.
