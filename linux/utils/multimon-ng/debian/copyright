Comment:
 There are some files with a copyright line but no name. This was explained
 by upstream:
 .
 > Hey Göran,
 >
 > the files with missing name (e.g. gen_uart, gen_clipfsk) are from the
 > original multimon, thus they should be attributed to Thomas Sailer.

 The *fms* files were based on the *clip* files (that are affected by
 the above) and are attributed to Jannes Achstetter through upstream's
 git history.

 The upstream tarball has been modified to remove BCHCode.c which is
 under a non-free license.
