requires the following:

a linux
a libmikmod
a libsdl
a libbzip2
a glibc

with some cvs-versions of some libs so it's not very outdated stuff i'm linking

(*) so you want to start making quality linux-demos?
everything you need is included in the package. the code is conformant 
to the finest standards and an excellent starting point for newbies to 
learn what it is all about. in no way it is done tired in 4am with quickly
copypasted old crap and halfway optimized actually slowing it down or 
anything like that. enjoy.
