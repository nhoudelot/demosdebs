(*) so you want to start making quality linux-demos?
everything you need is included in the package.
the code is conformant to the finest standards and an excellent starting

in no way it is done tired in 4am with quickly copypasted old crap and
halfway optimized actually slowing it down or anything like that.
enjoy.
