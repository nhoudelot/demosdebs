Some info, for the confused among you:
* Platform is OpenDingux (Linux-based) running on a Dingoo A320 (Chinese handheld console)
* 336Mhz MIPS, no GPU or other fancy stuff though
* Was supposed to be 4k, but couldn't quite make it fit, so it became 7.5k-ish
* Depends on libmodplug. Its somewhat common on OpenDingux installations though, and just in case its supplied with the binary
* 100% Partyprod, code and music entirely made during Payback (I hate tracking on headphones...)
* Was released as Wild, but was merged into the PC Introcompo as it was the only Wild entry and the PC introcompo is where it fits best, even though its not PC

# BUGS
No known bugs.
