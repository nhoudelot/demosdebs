Topy44 added Some info, for the confused among you: * Platform is
OpenDingux (Linux-based) running on a Dingoo A320 (Chinese handheld
console) * 336Mhz MIPS, no GPU or other fancy stuff though * Was
supposed to be 4k, but couldn\[cq]t quite make it fit, so it became
7.5k-ish * Depends on libmodplug.
Its somewhat common on OpenDingux installations though, and just in case
its supplied with the binary * 100% Partyprod, code and music entirely
made during Payback (I hate tracking on headphones\&...)
* Was released as Wild, but was merged into the PC Introcompo as it was
the only Wild entry and the PC introcompo is where it fits best, even
though its not PC
.SH BUGS
