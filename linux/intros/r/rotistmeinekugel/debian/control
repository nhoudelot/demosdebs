Description: 40k Intro for Linux, released in 2014
 Intro by Rtificial, released in 2014
 first Linux demo
 about  one year ago Rtificial watched the revision live stream  and decided
 to make a demo themselves
 .
 their goal was to release it at revision  2014. so they sat around and did
 nothing for three months.
 then they started working on tools but almost freaked out three weeks before
 revision as they had no content. they got ourselves together and
 hacked something together, proudly finishing it the night before.
 .
 this is the first demo they ever wrote so they asking to adjust your
 expectatotions.
