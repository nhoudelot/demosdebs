32-bit elf using SDL (for audio, keyboard/mouse and window creation) and
OpenGL Since it\[cq]s not tried and tested much, any feedback is much
welcome.
I really want to get our 64k releases to be on pair with the windows
versions if possible so I welcome any tips, tricks or discussions on the
subject.
Due to not having the wonderful tool called kkrunchy available on the
Linux platform the executable is packed with upx to about 76.5kb
(windows version with upx is about 74.4 kb).
My hope is that releasing more quality content on the Linux platform
might spark some progress of Linux packers and 64k development.
Maybe next time we will try to create a OSX binary as well.
.PP
For those interested the following tools where used: g++ strip sstrip
from ELFkickers upx
