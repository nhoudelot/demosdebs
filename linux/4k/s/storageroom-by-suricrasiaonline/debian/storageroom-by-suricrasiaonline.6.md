# SYNOPSIS
**storageroom-by-suricrasiaonline** [*options*]

# DESCRIPTION
**Storage Room** is a 2k executable graphics demo released by Suricrasia Online in june 2020.  
It requires a minimum resolution of **1920x1080**; behavior at lower resolutions is undefined and the demo may fail to render correctly or at all.

The demo can be exited at any time by pressing **Esc**

# OPTIONS
**Storage Room** does not accept command-line options directly.  
However, its rendering quality can be adjusted using an environment variable:

    Sets the number of samples used for rendering.  
    A higher number generally results in better image quality but may require more processing power.  
    The default value is 300.
