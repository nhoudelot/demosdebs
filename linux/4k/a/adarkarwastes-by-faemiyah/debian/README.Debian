adarkarwastes-by-faemiyah for Debian
----------------------------------

This is a standard version of the 4K intro, not the minimized "party" version.

The source code uses the USE_LD definition and does not generate music. 
Instead, it relies on existing WAV files and shaders.

I always prefer using the most basic binary format to ensure compatibility 
with dh_shlibdeps, allowing it to accurately identify dependencies.

Forcing music generation might be possible, but exploring the ASM code
suggests a loss of cross-platform compilation.

Cross-compilation is currently limited to 64-bit architectures due to an OpenMPI
dependency error. Therefore, the package is compiled with QEMU as a temporary 
solution until debian resolve the issue.
