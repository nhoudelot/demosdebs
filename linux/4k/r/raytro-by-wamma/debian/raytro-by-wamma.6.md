# NAME
raytro-by-wamma - is the command to run Raytro 

# SYNOPSIS
raytro-by-wamma [*options*]

# DESCRIPTION
Raytro 4k intro for GNU/Linux by glaze/wAMMA, released @ Pouet.net 2008-02-27

This is my first released 4k intro. I don't like C, especially
when coding 3D stuff, but C++ is too bloaty and asm is non-portable.
I didn't use music in this intro, because I'm more interested to
discover how much graphics code I can get into 4k.

I also tried to compile a win32 version using i586-mingw32msvc-gcc that
came with Kubuntu (it uses gcc 3.4.5). There was missing/weird graphics 
in some places, so I didn't include a win32 build.
