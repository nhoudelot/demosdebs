muffintrap [Code]

A Linux 4k intro for Instanssi 2019 4k compo.

By muffintrap of FCCCF

Tools used: Lubuntu 18.04, Spacemacs, Clang and zopfli.
Depends on SDL1.2 and OpenGL.

The original version will output very clippy and distorted audio. 
Execute at your own risk!

Fixed audio version is much more soothing to ears and speakers, but 
is still very raw square wave.

Both are self-extracting and executing bash scripts. 
Please  enjoy the pretty flowers.
