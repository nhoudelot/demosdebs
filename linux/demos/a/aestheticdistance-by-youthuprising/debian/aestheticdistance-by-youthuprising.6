Aesthetic Distance - A demo by Youth Uprising.
Produced November through December 2007.
Released at the Ultimate Meeting \[cq]07.
.PP
Inviting YOU to Icons 2008 From 6th to 8th June.

-DivX video and soundtrack (.mp3) are available at: [
http://thygrion.untergrund.net/ ] Along with more of our work.
.PP
-Mostly coded on a Pentium II 650mhz with 192MB RAM and a Geforce MX
4000.
.IP \[bu] 2
To run this decently a 1.5GHz machine is required and some horse power
out of the GPU (no shaders and only basic OpenGL stuff used so go
figure)
.IP \[bu] 2
There is a fallback option for certain open source graphics drivers.
So if the demo crawls, try it.
It will affect the graphics quality but doesn\[cq]t make the drivers
fallback => preserves decent framerate.

-Ferris\[cq] Notes: -This is the party version.
And the final version.
To me, those shouldn\[cq]t be two different things.
As far as bug fixes go for this, I haven\[cq]t noticed any except on
some cards with low video memory none of the particle effects work.
If this occurs, run it again with a lower resolution, or just download
the video version.
Oh yeah, there have also been some compatibility issues with Vista, but
I think that\[cq]s expected.
;)
.PP
-I threw in the inverted mode because I was bored :) .
It inverts the colors and it\[cq]s kinda neat, although I think it looks
better in the original color scheme.
.PP
-EVERYTHING in this intro has been hard-coded - all animation, camera
paths, etc., everything.
I really just don\[cq]t feel like coding a WYSIWYG demomaker like
Farbrausch or Conspiracy or Stravaganza or any of them - I don\[cq]t
have the time and I wouldn\[cq]t like to do it without the rest of my
group, so maybe we will once I have a stable internet connection again.
.PP
-I am 15 years old.
However, when this demo will be released, I will have only just turned
16.
Just thought I\[cq]d throw that out there.
:D
.PP
-Final thoughts: I like the demo as a whole more than anything I\[cq]ve
ever done.
Finally, especially with the music, I\[cq]m producing in a style that I
really feel strongly about.
I had more fun working on this project than I have making a demo in a
long time.
The only thing I regret is that the some of the group didn\[cq]t take
part in the production - I can never seem to talk to Decipher\&...well,
at least I actually had something that could be called design this time
;) .
.PP
-Waffle\[cq]s Notes: Well what do I see here.
I wasn\[cq]t going to participate in making of the demo at all but seems
like it\[cq]s 3AM and deadline approaches.
:) Not much to add.
It looks nice.
