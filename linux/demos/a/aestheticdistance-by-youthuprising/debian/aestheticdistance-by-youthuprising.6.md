Aesthetic Distance - A demo by Youth Uprising.
   Produced November through December 2007.
   Released at the Ultimate Meeting '07.

   Inviting YOU to Icons 2008
   From 6th to 8th June.
   Helsinki, Finland

-DivX video and soundtrack (.mp3) are available at:
   [   http://thygrion.untergrund.net/   ]
 Along with more of our work.

-Mostly coded on a Pentium II 650mhz with 192MB RAM and a
 Geforce MX 4000.

- To run this decently a 1.5GHz machine is required
  and some horse power out of the GPU
  (no shaders and only basic OpenGL stuff used so go figure)

- There is a fallback option for certain open source graphics drivers. 
  So if the demo crawls, try it.
  It will affect the graphics quality but doesn't make the drivers fallback
   => preserves decent framerate.

-Ferris' Notes:
 -This is the party version. And the final version.
  To me, those shouldn't be two different things. As
  far as bug fixes go for this, I haven't noticed any
  except on some cards with low video memory none of
  the particle effects work. If this occurs, run it
  again with a lower resolution, or just download the
  video version. Oh yeah, there have also been some
  compatibility issues with Vista, but I think that's
  expected. ;)

 -I threw in the inverted mode because I was bored :) .
  It inverts the colors and it's kinda neat, although
  I think it looks better in the original color scheme.

 -EVERYTHING in this intro has been hard-coded - all
  animation, camera paths, etc., everything. I
  really just don't feel like coding a WYSIWYG demomaker
  like Farbrausch or Conspiracy or Stravaganza or any of
  them - I don't have the time and I wouldn't like to
  do it without the rest of my group, so maybe we will
  once I have a stable internet connection again.

 -I am 15 years old. However, when this demo will be
  released, I will have only just turned 16. Just thought
  I'd throw that out there. :D

 -Final thoughts: I like the demo as a whole more than
  anything I've ever done. Finally, especially with the
  music, I'm producing in a style that I really feel
  strongly about. I had more fun working on this project
  than I have making a demo in a long time. The only
  thing I regret is that the some of the group didn't
  take part in the production - I can never seem to talk
  to Decipher...well, at least I actually had something
  that could be called design this time ;) .

 -Waffle's Notes:
  Well what do I see here. I wasn't going to participate
  in making of the demo at all but seems like it's 3AM
  and deadline approaches. :) Not much to add. It looks
  nice.
