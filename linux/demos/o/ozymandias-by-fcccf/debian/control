Description: Demo by FCCCF, released in 2019
 FCCCF presents Ozymandias at Assembly Summer 2019
 .
 This demo was meant to be bigger, bolder and more beautiful than the
 previous one, Lepus Minor. But then time went quickly, They got into
 trouble with the code and only the main idea survived and the rest 90%
 of the glorious plan got axed.
 .
 The demo was inspired by the poem Ozymandias by Percy Shelley, the 
 videogame Journey by Thatgamecompany and the song The Old Ways by
 Loreena McKennit.
