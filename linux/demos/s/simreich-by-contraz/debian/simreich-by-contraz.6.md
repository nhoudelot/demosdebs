    As usual for us we have spent an obscene amount of time creating
    this rather simple demo. This is our most delayed and troublesome 
    production to date. Almost 2 years in the making. At least some of 
    this time was used to make some serious improvements to our demo 
    system and 3D engine. We even teached our selves some 3D modelling
    and animation :)
    
    This time we wanted to try creating something darker than our 
    previous production that was a pretty softass 80's inspired demo. 
    
    Try to enjoy it :)
