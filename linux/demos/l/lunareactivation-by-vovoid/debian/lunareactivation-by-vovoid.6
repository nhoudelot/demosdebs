\f[B]hardware/software
requirements\f[R]_____________________________________________
.IP \[bu] 2
GNU/Linux (developed and tested on Ubuntu 10.04)
.IP \[bu] 2
An nvidia card; 9800 GTX or better, GTX 480 or GTX 580 preferred.
Do not expect a laptop GPU to run this demo, sorry\&...
.IP \[bu] 2
Quad-core CPU, developed on a core 2 quad with 800Mhz memory.
.IP \[bu] 2
intended for 1080p \[at] 60Hz but try it in 720p if you have a fast CPU,
your GPU might have issues with fillrate
.IP \[bu] 2
4GB of RAM for 1080p (depending on screen res)

Welcome to Vovoid\[cq]s latest demo - this time about Luna - an android
girl with a mission gone astray, wrongfully labeled as broken and dumped
through a burial portal at a cemetery for androids.
.PP
But the workers discover something amazing\&...

.PP
This demo has taken more than 3 years to make, so we hope you enjoy it!
A lot happens in threads, so a quad core machine is preferred.
Also 4GB of RAM is needed.
.PP
And please, please if possible view it in 1080p, it was designed for
that.
720p doesn\[cq]t do it justice and you miss out on a lot of details.
See the screenshots if you like.

\f[B]creative
process\f[R]___________________________________________________________
.PP
Describing a mood requires both graphics and music.
.PP
We intended for music and graphics to be closely connected and driving
each other.
We did this during the creative process, going back & forth between the
two, letting the mood of the demo inspire everything.
.PP
We hope this effort shows in the final product.
.PP
\f[B]test
results\f[R]_______________________________________________________________
.IP \[bu] 2
demo was developed and tested on ubuntu 10.04 with GTX 480
.IP \[bu] 2
demo was run on ubuntu 10.10 with GTX 580

\f[B]fun
facts\f[R]__________________________________________________________________
.IP \[bu] 2
This demo is 32Mb, of that 11Mb is the music
.IP \[bu] 2
we developed new animation tools for the character animation for tighter
control, supporting the iterative creative process.
.IP \[bu] 2
the \[lq]breathing\[rq] sky \[lq]blob\[rq] in the beginning is an
inflation simulation.
We change gas pressure and stiffness to make it breathe.
.IP \[bu] 2
we wanted to keep size down, so a lot of what you see is procedurally
generated, a lot of mesh generators, dynamic textures, generated
textures etc.
