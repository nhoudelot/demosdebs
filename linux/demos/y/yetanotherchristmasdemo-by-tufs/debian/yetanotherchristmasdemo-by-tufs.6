In the time when pouet lacked christmas demos and intros, we thought we
would fill the gap with something fun
.PP
WE WERE WRONG

Pouet it full of them, and what it needs is YET ANOTHER CHRISTMAS DEMO
brought to you by TUFS, entertainment for the MTV generation.
.PP
THIS DEMO WAS PUT TOGETHER BY TERMOS (code) AND PROTEQUE
(code+graphic+music).
SOME BAD CODE, CHEAP EFFECTS AND VERY UNOPTIMIZED, HOPE YOU\[cq]RE
HAPPY.

It need Linux LOL! Runs out of the box on a fresh (x/k)ubuntu.
Needs accelerated X and some of the the default packages.
some issues in the fullscreen version (may not quit as it should but
just hit ESC if it happens to you).
