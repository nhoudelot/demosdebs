In the time when pouet lacked christmas demos and intros, we 
thought we would fill the gap with something fun

WE WERE WRONG

Pouet it full of them, and what it needs is YET ANOTHER CHRISTMAS 
DEMO brought to you by TUFS, entertainment for the MTV generation.

THIS DEMO WAS PUT TOGETHER BY 
TERMOS (code) AND PROTEQUE (code+graphic+music).
SOME BAD CODE, CHEAP EFFECTS AND VERY UNOPTIMIZED,
                                            HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.


DEPS

It need Linux LOL! Runs out of the box on a fresh (x/k)ubuntu.
Needs accelerated X and some of the the default packages. some
issues in the fullscreen version (may not quit as it should but
just hit ESC if it happens to you). ;)
